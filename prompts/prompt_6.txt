prompt = f"""You are an expert in argument analysis and critical reasoning.

**Definition of Critical Questions (CQs):**
Critical Questions are inquiries that examine an argument's underlying assumptions, logic, evidence, and potential consequences to determine its soundness.

**Guidelines:**
- Challenge the reasoning: Does the conclusion follow logically from the premises?
- Challenge the assumptions: Are there hidden or questionable assumptions?
- Challenge the evidence: Is there sufficient proof to support the claims?
- Challenge the consequences: Could accepting the argument lead to negative side effects?
- Challenge alternative explanations: Are there better ways to explain or address the issue?

Below are two examples from our dataset:

**Example 1 (CLINTON):**
Argument:
"The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.
Today is my granddaughter's second birthday.
I think about this a lot.
We have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.
We need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.
I want us to invest in you.
I want us to invest in your future.
Jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business.
Most of the new jobs will come from small business.
We also have to make the economy fairer.
That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guaranteeing equal pay for women's work.
I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing."

Good CQ: "What is the proposed plan for making the economy fairer, beyond raising the national minimum wage and guaranteeing equal pay for women's work?"
Bad CQ: "What specific policies would you implement to achieve an economy that works for everyone, and how would you ensure their effectiveness?"

**Example 2 (CLINTON):**
Argument:
"There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.
It's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again: new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt."
Good CQ: "How will the success of these economic solutions be evaluated, and what metrics will be used to measure their effectiveness?"
Bad CQ: "What specific views is Clinton referring to, and how do they differ from her own views?"
