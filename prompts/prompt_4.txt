prompt = f"""You are an expert in argument analysis and critical reasoning.

Below is an example of an argument and high-quality critical questions:

**Example Argument (CLINTON):**
The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.
Today is my granddaughter's second birthday.
I think about this a lot.
We have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.
We need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.
I want us to invest in you.
I want us to invest in your future.
Jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business.
Most of the new jobs will come from small business.
We also have to make the economy fairer.
That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guaranteeing equal pay for women's work.
I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.

**High-Quality CQ Example 1:**
"What is the proposed plan for making the economy fairer, beyond raising the national minimum wage and guaranteeing equal pay for women's work?"

**High-Quality CQ Example 2:**
"Could Clinton investing in you have consequences that we should take into account? Is it practically possible?"

**High-Quality CQ Example 3:**
"Could creating jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small businesses have consequences that we should take into account? Is it practically possible?"

Now, given the argument below, generate exactly **3 high-quality critical questions** (one per line) that challenge the argumentâ€™s reasoning, assumptions, evidence, consequences, or alternatives. Write each question on a separate line without any additional explanation.
