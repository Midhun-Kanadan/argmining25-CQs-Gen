**Definition of Critical Questions (CQs):**
Critical Questions are inquiries designed to uncover and challenge the assumptions, logic, evidence, and consequences within an argument, thereby assessing its overall strength.

**How to Construct High-Quality Critical Questions:**
1. Challenge the reasoning: Does the conclusion logically follow from the premises?
2. Challenge the assumptions: What hidden assumptions underlie the argument?
3. Challenge the evidence: Is there sufficient proof supporting the argument's claims?
4. Challenge the consequences: Could there be unintended negative outcomes if the argument is accepted?
5. Challenge alternative explanations: Are there other, better explanations or solutions?

**Final Self-Assessment Check:**
After generating each question, ask yourself: "Can the answer to this question diminish the acceptability of the argument?" Only questions that pass this check are high-quality.

**Example (from CLINTON):**
Argument:
"The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.
Today is my granddaughter's second birthday.
I think about this a lot.
We have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.
We need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.
I want us to invest in you.
I want us to invest in your future.
Jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business.
Most of the new jobs will come from small business.
We also have to make the economy fairer.
That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guaranteeing equal pay for women's work.
I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing."

Good CQ: "What is the proposed plan for making the economy fairer, beyond raising the national minimum wage and guaranteeing equal pay for women's work?"
Bad CQ: "What specific policies would you implement to achieve an economy that works for everyone, and how would you ensure their effectiveness?"
*(The good CQ passes the self-assessment check because its answer could diminish the argument's acceptability.)*

Now, generate exactly **3 high-quality critical questions** for the argument below. Write each question on a separate line without any additional explanation, and ensure each question passes the self-assessment check.
