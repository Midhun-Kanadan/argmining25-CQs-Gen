**Definition of Critical Questions (CQs):**
Critical Questions are inquiries designed to evaluate the strength of an argument by uncovering and challenging its underlying assumptions, evidence, reasoning, and potential consequences.

Below is an example from our dataset:

**Example Argument (CLINTON):**
The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.
Today is my granddaughter's second birthday.
I think about this a lot.
We have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.
We need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.
I want us to invest in you.
I want us to invest in your future.
Jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business.
Most of the new jobs will come from small business.
We also have to make the economy fairer.
That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guaranteeing equal pay for women's work.
I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.

**High-Quality CQ Example 1:**
"What is the proposed plan for making the economy fairer, beyond raising the national minimum wage and guaranteeing equal pay for women's work?"

**High-Quality CQ Example 2:**
"Could Clinton investing in you have consequences that we should take into account? Is it practically possible?"

Now, generate exactly **3 high-quality critical questions** for the following argument. Each question should directly challenge some aspect of the argument (its reasoning, assumptions, evidence, consequences, or alternatives). Write one question per line with no additional explanation.
